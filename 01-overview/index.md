DevOps Secrets Vault (DSV) offers a cross-platform solution for command-line and scripted access to secrets stored in a hosted Secret Server vault.

* You can directly operate DSV from the command line, entering DSV commands and observing the Secret Server responses in real time.

    This can make it easier to resolve Help Desk cases involving Secret Server issues affecting specific users or applicatios.

* You can deploy DSV as command sequences (scripts) within a machine image or application container.

  This allows applications to securely obtain and use secrets, such as passwords, during execution—avoiding reliance on credentials insecurely embedded in the application’s code.

  By enabling secure communications between applications and Secret Server, DSV opens a path to previously unattainable levels of security for enterprise IT.

While Secret Server operates on-premises or in the cloud, DSV (being a command line application) must be installed locally on each workstation where it will be used. Thycotic offers DSV executables for Windows, Linux, and the MacOS.
