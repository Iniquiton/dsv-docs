DSV extensions support its use with other tools. Currently, we offer two extensions.

* Our **Jenkins** extension supports shops using Jenkins to support continuous integration.

* We offer a **Kubernetes** extension for organizations using Kubernetes to manage containerized applications.

Additionally, for customers interested in creating their own extensions to
integrate DSV into their infrastructure, we provide the **DSV Java SDK**.
