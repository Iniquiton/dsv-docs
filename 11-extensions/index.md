DSV extensions support its use with other tools. Currently, we offer two extensions.

* Our [Jenkins](.\01-jenkins.htm) extension supports shops using Jenkins for continuous integration.

* We offer a [Kubernetes](.\02-kubernetes.htm) extension for organizations using Kubernetes to manage containerized applications.

Extensions expected in future DSV releases include Puppet, OpenShift, Chef, Ansible, and Salt, among others.

Additionally, for customers interested in creating their own extensions to integrate DSV into their infrastructure, we provide the [DSV Java SDK](.\03-dsvjavasdk.htm).
