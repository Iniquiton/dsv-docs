# Overview

DevOps Secrets Vault marks an expansion of Thycotic’s product line toward developer empowerment. It meets your technical staff where they live—at the command line—and talks to your applications in the language they speak, through an API.

## DevOps Secrets Vault in One Sentence

DevOps Secrets Vault (DSV) offers a cross-platform, state-of-the-art solution for securing your organization’s secrets (most commonly, credentials) in a cloud-hosted vault, where your staff administer them using a robust Command Line Interface (CLI) and your applications access them programmatically by calls to an extensive RESTful API.

## Application Model

Thycotic created DevOps Secrets Vault in congruence with the Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) model, in that the secrets vaults and the API reside in the Cloud, and Thycotic must provision each customer with a tenancy. However, the CLI (Command Line Interface) must be considered core to the product as well, and this installs locally, with executables available for Windows, Linux, and MacOS.

DevOps Secrets Vault characteristics include:

* efficient Command Line Interface (CLI)
* automation-oriented Application Programming Interface (API) in the REST architectural style
* cutting edge use of Amazon Web Services (AWS) serverless architecture for the API, ensuring strong security, high availability, and automatic unlimited scaling for capacity
* designed for speed and agility with microservices
* local caching to handle high performance workloads
* multiple cloud authentication methods—AWS, Azure, and (planned) Google Cloud
* support for multiple programming languages and DevOps tools via SDKs and plugins (currently, Jenkins and Kubernetes; Java SDK available)
* SOC2 conformant—affirmative audit results by independent organization available

## A Developer’s Tool as Much as an Application

Because it provides both a Command Line Interface (CLI) for human operators and an Application Programming Interface (API) for programmatic operators, DSV makes credentials readily available even as they remain highly secure. With DSV optimized for automation and SOC2 compliant, no excuse remains for risky practices like hardcoding credentials in configuration files, or storing them in an Excel spreadsheet.

Credentials and many other secrets will often be written as JSON objects, but DevOps Secrets Vault accepts almost any file as a secret, for example, sensitive legal documents or spreadsheets. This creates almost endless use cases, limited only by your creativity.

Furthermore, the API, being RESTful, uses  HTTP requests to GET, PUT, POST and otherwise engage data. That makes the API forthright to learn and use—DevOps Secrets Server brings power without bringing complexity that would stand between you and your solutions building.

## Offered by Subscription or for Free

In line with market norms for cloud applications, Thycotic provides DevOps Secrets Vault on a subscription basis. However, to support evaluation by potential customers, instead of a time-constrained trial version Thycotic offers a feature-complete free version limited to 250 secrets, with API calls capped at 2500 per month.
