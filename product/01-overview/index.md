# Overview

DevOps Secrets Vault marks an expansion of Thycotic’s product line to include back-office and developer tools. It meets your technical staff where they live—at the command line—and talks to your applications in the language they speak, through an API. DevOps Secrets Vault allows faster secrets operations at higher volumes, suiting it for use within applications and containers. 

## DevOps Secrets Vault in One Sentence

DevOps Secrets Vault (DSV) offers a cross-platform, up to date solution for securing your organization’s secrets (most commonly, credentials) in a cloud-hosted vault, where your staff administer them using a Command Line Interface (CLI) and your applications access them programmatically by calls to a RESTful API.

## Application Model

Thycotic created DevOps Secrets Vault in congruence with the Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) model, in that the secrets vaults and the API reside in the Cloud, and Thycotic must provision each customer with a tenancy. However, the CLI (Command Line Interface) must be considered core to the product as well, and this installs locally, with executables available for Windows, Linux, and MacOS.

DevOps Secrets Vault characteristics include:

* efficient Command Line Interface (CLI)
* automation-oriented Application Programming Interface (API) in the REST architectural style
* Amazon Web Services (AWS) serverless architecture for the API, ensuring strong security, high availability, and automatic unlimited scaling for capacity
* designed for speed and agility with microservices
* local caching to handle high performance workloads
* multiple cloud authentication methods—AWS, Azure, and (planned) Google Cloud
* support for multiple programming languages and DevOps tools via extensions and SDKs (currently, Jenkins and Kubernetes; Java SDK available)
* SOC2 conformant—affirmative audit results by independent organization available

## Tools for Development

Because it provides both a Command Line Interface (CLI) for human operators and an Application Programming Interface (API) for programmatic operators, DSV makes credentials both readily available and highly secure. With DSV SOC2 conformant and optimized for automation, you can eliminate risky practices like hardcoding credentials in configuration files, or storing them in an Excel spreadsheet.

Credentials and many other secrets will often be written as JSON objects, but to support a broad range of use cases, DevOps Secrets Vault accepts almost any file as a secret, for example, sensitive legal documents or spreadsheets.

The API, being RESTful, uses  HTTP requests to GET, PUT, POST and otherwise engage data. Because that is familiar territory for developers, the DSV learning curve is not steep. This reduced complexity is a deliberate feature of DSV that supports faster development cycles and more supportable solutions.
