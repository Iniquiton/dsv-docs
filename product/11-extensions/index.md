DSV Extensions

DSV extensions support its use with other tools. So far, two extensions work with DSV:

* [Jenkins](.\.\extensions\jenkins\index.htm) for organizations using Jenkins for continuous integration

* [Kubernetes](.\.\extensions\kubernetes\index.htm) for organizations using Kubernetes to manage containerized applications

Extensions expected in future DSV releases include Puppet, OpenShift, Chef, Ansible, and Salt, among others.

Additionally, for customers interested in creating their own extensions to integrate DSV into their infrastructure, Thycotic provides the [DSV Java SDK](.\.\extensions\dsv-javasdk\index.htm).
